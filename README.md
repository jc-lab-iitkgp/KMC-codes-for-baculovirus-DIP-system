# KMC-codes-for-baculovirus-DIP-system
Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation codes for predicting DIP genome length distribution in Baculovirus infection of insect cells

%% Experimental Results
1. Results for uninfected cell system are stored in CU_density.mat

2. Passage experimental results are stored in exp_psg1.mat , exp_psg5.mat, 
   exp_psg9.mat, and exp_psg12.mat for passages 1, 5, 9, and 12 respectively.

%% Monte Carlo simulation
1. Run the MATLAB code Main_MC.m to generate results.

2. For plotting of genome length distributions for different passages run 
   plot_P1_dist.m , plot_P5_dist.m, plot_P9_dist.m , and plot_P12_dist.m respectively.

2. The value of k_div is estimeted using Estimate_k_div.m
